                    <p className="my-2">If you are looking for a highly experienced, result-driven IT
                        professional to take your team or organization from good to great,
                        I am the person for that job. I am a very curious individual, with
                        the unique ability of harnessing that curiosity and turning it into
                        innovative and impactful actions. I have a track record of being an
                        innovative and adaptive team member with a unquenchable passion
                        for technology and solving problems while challenging the status
                        quo. “This is the way we’ve always done it” doesn’t cut it anymore.</p>
                    <p className="my-2">For over 20 years, I have taken on progressively more responsibility
                        with a broad range of technical and managerial experiences, but
                        never stop learning from my experiences and from others. My
                        diverse background allows me to bring unique and transparent
                        perspectives, positively challenge the status quo, and help
                        individuals and teams achieve more then they think possible.</p>
                    <p className="my-2">It is not uncommon for me to be working on multiple high-priority
                        projects simultaneously while prioritizing the workload and
                        maintaining the integrity and quality of the work being done. I am
                        also proficient at developing, innovating, and implementing new
                        strategies for evolving and transforming the team and organization.
                        Day to day duties involves program/project management, solution
                        delivery, strategy & road mapping, solution architecture, and team
                        leadership</p>
                    <p className="my-2">Overall, I offer to you a wide range of skills and experience in people
                        and technical management. Other core skills include:</p>
