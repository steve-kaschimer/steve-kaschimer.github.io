# Work Routing

How to decide who handles what.

## Routing Table

| Work Type | Route To | Examples |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Architecture & technical decisions | Elliot | Site structure, plugin choices, security posture, tradeoff calls |
| Security review | Elliot | Dependency risk, secrets exposure, supply chain review |
| GitHub Actions & pipelines | Darlene | New workflows, CI changes, secrets management, `npm audit` in CI |
| Eleventy templates & build | Mr. Robot | `.eleventy.js`, Nunjucks layouts, Tailwind config, plugin wiring, build scripts |
| Blog posts & technical writing | Trenton | Draft posts, edit posts, front matter, content strategy |
| GitHub Pages deployment | Romero | Deploy workflows, `CNAME`, release tagging, deploy verification |
| Code review | Elliot | Architecture and security; Mr. Robot for template PRs; Darlene for workflow PRs |
| Scope & priorities | Elliot | What to build next, trade-offs, backlog decisions |
| Async issue work (bugs, tests, small features) | @copilot 🤖 | Well-defined tasks matching capability profile |
| Session logging | Scribe | Automatic — never needs routing |
| Backlog status & stall detection | Ralph | Start-of-session summaries, identifying blocked work |

## Issue Routing

| Label | Action | Who |
|-------|--------|-----|
| `squad` | Triage: analyze issue, evaluate @copilot fit, assign `squad:{member}` label | Lead |
| `squad:{name}` | Pick up issue and complete the work | Named member |
| `squad:copilot` | Assign to @copilot for autonomous work (if enabled) | @copilot 🤖 |

### How Issue Assignment Works

1. When a GitHub issue gets the `squad` label, the **Lead** triages it — analyzing content, evaluating @copilot's capability profile, assigning the right `squad:{member}` label, and commenting with triage notes.
2. **@copilot evaluation:** The Lead checks if the issue matches @copilot's capability profile (🟢 good fit / 🟡 needs review / 🔴 not suitable). If it's a good fit, the Lead may route to `squad:copilot` instead of a squad member.
3. When a `squad:{member}` label is applied, that member picks up the issue in their next session.
4. When `squad:copilot` is applied and auto-assign is enabled, `@copilot` is assigned on the issue and picks it up autonomously.
5. Members can reassign by removing their label and adding another member's label.
6. The `squad` label is the "inbox" — untriaged issues waiting for Lead review.

### Lead Triage Guidance for @copilot

When triaging, the Lead should ask:

1. **Is this well-defined?** Clear title, reproduction steps or acceptance criteria, bounded scope → likely 🟢
2. **Does it follow existing patterns?** Adding a test, fixing a known bug, updating a dependency → likely 🟢
3. **Does it need design judgment?** Architecture, API design, UX decisions → likely 🔴
4. **Is it security-sensitive?** Auth, encryption, access control → always 🔴
5. **Is it medium complexity with specs?** Feature with clear requirements, refactoring with tests → likely 🟡

## Rules

1. **Eager by default** — spawn all agents who could usefully start work, including anticipatory downstream work.
2. **Scribe always runs** after substantial work, always as `mode: "background"`. Never blocks.
3. **Quick facts → coordinator answers directly.** Don't spawn an agent for "what port does the server run on?"
4. **When two agents could handle it**, pick the one whose domain is the primary concern.
5. **"Team, ..." → fan-out.** Spawn all relevant agents in parallel as `mode: "background"`.
6. **Anticipate downstream work.** If a feature is being built, spawn the tester to write test cases from requirements simultaneously.
7. **Issue-labeled work** — when a `squad:{member}` label is applied to an issue, route to that member. The Lead handles all `squad` (base label) triage.
8. **@copilot routing** — when evaluating issues, check @copilot's capability profile in `team.md`. Route 🟢 good-fit tasks to `squad:copilot`. Flag 🟡 needs-review tasks for PR review. Keep 🔴 not-suitable tasks with squad members.
